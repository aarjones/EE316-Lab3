NOT STARTED:
	top level connections
	xdc connections
	hardware setup
		op-amp adder (op-amp with 10v)
			non inverting summing amplifier
		filter (2nd order+)
		ADC (can run on 5v)
		LCD (run on 5v)
	debugging (obviously)
		i2c adc
		system_controller

IN PROGRESS:
	i2c 1: Gianna
		lcd
	Clock: Chris
		500-1500 hz
		don't take adc input for sampling mode/analog signal/waveform generator
		Counter that runs to (adc input + 500 baseline) / 2
			invert whenever counter reach
			left shift adc input by 2 bits (multiply by 4)
				might also need to invert it or something...start without.  Deal with this if the potentiometer works backwards

COMPLETED:
	i2c 2: Aaron
		ADC
			address is 1001111
			to read from the adc:
				just send address and "read"
			to change which channel:
				send address and write
				then send control byte
					0000_00 & adc_sel
	Reset Delay
	PWM - Aaron
		highest frequency? 
		Depends on sampling rate of adc
			Dependent on i2c speed?
			Max input wave ~500-750 hz?
		convert to 8 bit input data
	System: Aaron
		btn0: reset
		btn1: select inputs for pwm and toggle clock generation
			1 for each input of the ADC
			Therefore the change is in the command sent to the i2c adc
		LEDs: which sensor input is being used for the clock
