NOT STARTED:
	top level connections
	xdc connections
	hardware setup
		op-amp adder
		filter (2nd order+)
		ADC
		LCD
	Clock
		500-1500 hz
		don't take adc input for sampling mode/analog signal/waveform generator
		Counter that runs to (adc input + 500 baseline) / 2
			invert whenever counter reach
			left shift adc input by 2 bits (multiply by 4)
				might also need to invert it or something...start without.  Deal with this if the potentiometer works backwards
	System
		btn0: reset
		btn1: select inputs for pwm and toggle clock generation
			1 for each input of the ADC
			Therefore the change is in the command sent to the i2c adc
		LEDs: which sensor input is being used for the clock
	i2c 1:
		lcd
	i2c 2: 
		ADC
	

IN PROGRESS:

COMPLETED:
	Reset Delay
	PWM - Aaron
		highest frequency? 
		Depends on sampling rate of adc
			Dependent on i2c speed?
			Max input wave ~500-750 hz?
		convert to 8 bit input data
